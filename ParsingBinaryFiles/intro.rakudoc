4. Unpacking your data (using unpack)

5. Reading data from Blobs

=head3 Examples

To give concrete examples, a simple MIDI file is used.
The actual file is aailable as
L<https://github.com/kjpyr/blog/ParsingBinaryFiles/thestar.midi>.
This is a ersion of I<Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star>.
It was generated using L<Lilypond|https://lilypond.org>.
The lilypond source (as well as a generated pdf score)
is available from the same place as the midi file.
